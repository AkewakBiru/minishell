if there is no env var, seg fault when export is used (easy fix) -> fixed
exit | exit | exit | exit | pwd - shouldn't exit but it is -> fixed
exit status needs fix
shlvl is not being updated. It should be. - increase shell level whenever the ./minishell executable is run. it starts from 2 -> fixed
lots of mem-leaks
lots of norme_errors
signal problems in child process (easy fix) -> fixed
ctrl + c segfaults in heredoc, because of (get_next_line protection problem)
redirection problem not fully fixed

pipeline -> exit | exit | exit | pwd | exit - shouldn't exit (don't know why?)

echo'' <$asddsaf< 8 -> opening heredoc, because expansion expands to nothing and the < symbols combine to form << -> it is called ambiguous redirect
(when an env var gets expanded to nothing and used as a redirection operand) -> i don't know if we need to handle it

<< $sdp -> syntax error
<< a cat > test - doesn't work

for ambiguous redirection: if there is a redirection sign (< or >>  or >) to the left of an expansion and the expansion results
in nothing, that is an ambiguous redirection.

< a < b < c cat - we are treating cat as an argument when it is a command

$_ -> doesn't work. should we handle it?

<< $sdf -> shouldn't expand if it is not in env and should be taken as it is.

< $adf -> ambiguous redirect

< $adf | ls -> ambiguous but execution continues after the pipe.

$PWD/minishell

export PATH="$PATH:." - not working.

i have to look into how the command is formed -> if / is found in the command, i am not joining env to the command.
