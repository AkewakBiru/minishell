if there is no env var, seg fault when export is used (easy fix) -> fixed
exit | exit | exit | exit | pwd - shouldn't exit but it is -> fixed
exit status needs fix
shlvl is not being updated. It should be. - increase shell level whenever the ./minishell executable is run. it starts from 2 -> fixed
lots of mem-leaks
lots of norme_errors
signal problems in child process (easy fix) -> fixed
ctrl + c segfaults in heredoc, because of (get_next_line protection problem)
redirection problem not fully fixed

pipeline -> exit | exit | exit | pwd | exit - shouldn't exit (don't know why?)

echo'' <$asddsaf< 8 -> opening heredoc, because expansion expands to nothing and the < symbols combine to form << -> it is called ambiguous redirect
(when an env var gets expanded to nothing and used as a redirection operand) -> i don't know if we need to handle it

<< $sdp -> syntax error
